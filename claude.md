# CLAUDE.md
## Architecture
This is a frontend-only React app (Vite + React 18), with Tailwind CSS, no backend (data comes from a mock REST file or localStorage).  
## Style guide
- Use functional components + hooks.  
- Use CSS modules or Tailwind (our preference: Tailwind).  
- File naming: `PascalCase.tsx` for components.
